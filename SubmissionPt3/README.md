Project was created using python 2.7. Everything for part 3 should be working. We didn't have test cases demonstrating how multiple errors should be printed for the same line, so my particular ordering might be off. Function calls always have their expressions evaluated for errors, even if they are undefined.


The directory workdir contains everything you need to run my code. Because the project is written in python you don't need to run build.sh, it's just an empty file.

To run a test and plop the results in some file, use exec.sh. Here is one example:

    ./exec.sh ../samples2/control.decaf > ../results/control.out
